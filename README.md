# About FinForum
For our hackathon submission our group has created a online budgeting assistant. The user can create budgets by filling out fields such as expenses, income streams, and then our website will help the user better organize their overall finances. There is also a forum aspect where the user can interact with other members to discuss aspects of each otherâ€™s budgets and share stories and advice. The user may also create an account so that their budgets can be saved online. For front end, our website utilizes ReactJS and Vite. We are using SQLite as a database. We are using Google cloud as a host for our forum which is running off of phpbb. We built this project because we believe that many people lack proper organization skills and finances is one of the worst places to find yourself unorganized.
